# Data Structures and Algorithms in C/C++

Here you'll find exercises in C/C++ (with many comments/notes, much like a notebook) for the course "Mastering Data Structures &amp; Algorithms using C and C++", by Abdul Bari.  
Please note that some of the code found here don't follow best practices such as avoiding the use of global variables, for example.

# Why C/C++?

I've decided to take this course as a head start for the upcoming lectures on Data Structures in my university (3rd semester). C++ is the programming language we'll use and it's widely known as a great programming language to build a strong foundation.

You can find Abdul Bari's course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/).

## In order to download the files:

If you have `git` installed, you can clone this repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/kdmoreira/DSA-c-cpp-udemy.git
```

Or you can simply download the `.zip` file by clicking on the button "Clone" in the repository's [homepage](https://github.com/kdmoreira/DSA-c-cpp-udemy).

I personally use **Code::Blocks** to develop and compile the code. The compiler used is the GNU GCC Compiler, with g++ following the C++14 ISO C++ language standard.
