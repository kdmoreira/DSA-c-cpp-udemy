# Data Structures and Algorithms in C/C++

---

Here you'll find exercises in C/C++ (with many comments, much like a notebook) for the course "Mastering Data Structures &amp; Algorithms using C and C++", by Abdul Bari.

# Why C/C++?

I've decided to take this course as a head start for the upcoming lectures on Data Structures in my university (3rd semester). C++ is the programming language we'll use and it's widely known as a great programming language to build a strong foundation.

You can find Abdul Bari's course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/).

I also use a book to expand on C/C++ concepts: "C++ Crash Course: a fast-paced introduction", by Josh Lospinoso. You can find it [here](https://www.amazon.com.br/C-Crash-Course-Josh-Lospinoso/dp/1593278888/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=c%2B%2B+crash+course+josh&qid=1607734307&s=digital-text&sr=1-1-catcorr).

## In order to download the files:

If you have `git` installed, you can clone this repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/DSA-cpp-udemy.git
```

Or you can simply download the `.zip` file by clicking on the button "Clone" in the repository's [homepage](https://github.com/DSA-cpp-udemy).

I personally use **Code::Blocks** to develop and compile the code.
